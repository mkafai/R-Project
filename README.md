R-Project
=========

# Contains code for the Getting and Cleaning data course project

There is one main script for this project named run_analysis.R.
The data is stored in the har_data folder. The run_analysis.R file and the har_data folder should both be in the home directory.
To run the script use source("run_analysis.R").
Running the script will result in a data frame called tidy_data (180*68).
