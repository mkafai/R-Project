R-Project
=========

# Contains code for the Getting and Cleaning data course project

There is one script for this project named run_analysis.R.
The script assumes that all the required data files are in the home directory. 
Running the script will result in a dataframe called tidy_data.
The "reshape2" library should be loaded before executing the script.
